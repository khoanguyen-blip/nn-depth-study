# Day 1 — Research Setup

## Why this project?
I want to understand neural networks beyond using libraries.
By building and expanding a network layer by layer, I can directly observe how depth changes learning behavior.

## Planned approach
- Start with a simple baseline (1 hidden layer)
- Gradually increase the number of hidden layers
- Keep dataset and training settings fixed
- Record accuracy and observations for each model

## Personal note
This project focuses on learning and exploration rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance.
