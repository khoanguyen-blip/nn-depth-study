GLOBAL INTERPRETATION (INTERIM)
Append-only timeline:
This file records evolving interpretations and is not retroactively edited.

Purpose: Track provisional interpretations and hypotheses during depth experiments.
Status: Preliminary – subject to revision as more depths are evaluated.
Observed pattern (so far):
- As depth increases from 2 to 4, training loss tends to plateau earlier and exhibits increased oscillation.
- This behavior is consistently observed under the same optimizer and learning rate.
Working hypothesis:
- Under a fixed learning rate and optimization setup, increasing depth amplifies optimization instability, which may contribute to earlier loss plateaus.
Optimization vs capacity:
- Given the simplicity of the circle dataset, representational capacity is unlikely to be the primary bottleneck.
- The observed training behavior therefore suggests optimization-related constraints under the current regime.
Interim conclusion (so far):
- Increasing depth alone has not consistently improved training behavior under controlled conditions.
- These interpretations are preliminary and will be revisited as deeper models are evaluated.
