(C5) Minimal Interpretation : 
-suggest stable but slow optimization with limited late-stage gains


WRITTEN OBSERVATION: 
The training loss showed a smooth decrease throughout training, with mostly stable behavior and slight oscillations. After approximately 100 epochs, the loss began to plateau, exhibiting diminishing improvement during later stages. Overall, this behavior suggests stable optimization with limited late-stage gains
Overall, this behavior suggests stable but slow optimization with limited late-stage gains.

ACCURACY(TRAINING, SINGLE RUN): 0.9945

_____ADDITIONAL METRICS_____
Metrics below are computed using 10 independent runs and are not used for the loss observations above.
TRAIN ACCURACY(MEAN OF 10 RUNS): 0.9961 ± 0.0010
TEST  ACCURACY(MEAN OF 10 RUNS): 0.9928 ± 0.0028

CONTEXT UPDATE(APPLICABLE TO PREVIOUS DAYS):
As of Day 11, model performance for this depth is evaluated using both training accuracy and testing accuracy, averaged across 10 independent runs with different random seeds. This update addresses potential luck bias present in earlier single-run evaluations.
The displayed loss curve is taken from a representative single run (fixed seed) and serves to characterize the typical training dynamics for this depth.
