(C5) Minimal Interpretation : 
-suggests stable optimization with minimal late-stage gains

WRITTEN OBSERVATION: 
The training loss showed a smooth decrease throughout training, with mostly stable behavior and slight oscillations. After approximately 100 epochs, the loss began to plateau, exhibiting diminishing improvement during later stages. 
Overall, this behavior suggests that the depth-2 model converges stably but reaches a slower improvement phase during later training

ACCURACY(TRAINING, SINGLE RUN): 0.998


_____ADDITIONAL METRICS_____
Metrics below are computed using 10 independent runs and are not used for the loss observations above.
TRAIN ACCURACY(MEAN OF 10 RUNS): 0.9982 ± 0.0019
TEST  ACCURACY(MEAN OF 10 RUNS): 0.9938 ± 0.0030

CONTEXT UPDATE(APPLICABLE TO PREVIOUS DAYS):
As of Day 11, model performance for this depth is evaluated using both training accuracy and testing accuracy, averaged across 10 independent runs with different random seeds. This update reduces variance associated with single-seed evaluation.
The displayed loss curve is taken from a representative single run (fixed seed) and serves to characterize the typical training dynamics for this depth.
