Studying the effect of neural network depth using NumPy
# Neural Network Depth Study (NumPy)

## Introduction
This project explores how the number of hidden layers affects the learning ability of a simple neural network implemented from scratch using NumPy.

## Research Question
How does increasing the number of hidden layers impact model accuracy and learning behavior when trained on the same dataset?

## Initial Hypothesis
Increasing depth will improve performance on non-linear datasets up to a certain point, after which training becomes less stable or inefficient.

## Scope
- Fully connected neural networks
- Implemented from scratch (no PyTorch / TensorFlow)
- Fixed dataset and training procedure
